# RSA-encryption


RSA encryption made using public key infrastructure made by using node js and socket io to serve as the KDC.
 generation of keys and encryption and decryption are made on the client side, the server side only manages the socket ids and maps them to the public key.  

## How to use it?

very simple steps, open your terminal and type:

`git clone https://github.com/mesho23/RSA-encryption.git`

`cd RSA-encryption/`

`npm i`

`node app.js`

and now you can use it by going to your browser and accessing localhost:3030

if you face an error in npm i or node app.js, this means you donâ€™t have them installed
