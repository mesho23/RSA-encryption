# RSA-encryption
RSA encryption made using public key infrastructure made by using node js and socket io to serve as the KDC.
 generation of keys and encryption and decryption are made on the client side, the server side only manages the socket ids and maps them to the public key.  

note you need to install all the npm modules.
